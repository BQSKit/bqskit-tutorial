    "We will solve the Hubbard Model using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. The Hubbard Model (HM) has a range of uses, most notably in solid-state physics to explain phase transitions and other correlated behaviors. There are several variations of the HM, but in essence, the model describes interacting particles on a lattice. Despite its apparent simplicity, it is hard to solve on a classical computer because the known algorithms scale exponentially unless further approximations are made. In this tutorial, we will use the VQE algorithm to estimate the energy ground states of different configurations of an HM."

    "\n",
    "We will restrict ourselves to a Hubbard Model with fermions (such as electrons), i.e. the Fermi-Hubbard Model. A visualization of an example with a 2x2 grid with spinful electrons is shown below. Electrons being fermions means that two electrons can not occupy the same quantum state. Because the electrons have spin, there can thus be at most two electrons per site (one spin-up, one spin-down). The model is characterized by an interaction term 'U', which only contributes if a spin-up and a spin-down electron occupy the same site; and by a \"hopping\" term 't', representing the kinetic energy in the system. In this basic model, only hops to neighboring sites are considered.\n",

    "Fermion algebra is only a subset of what a quantum computer can express, since fermions are interchangeable and many states are thus completely equivalent, whereas qubits are identifiable (each one has a well defined location on a chip or ion trap, for example). Thus, it is useful to perform a mapping from fermion to qubit algebra that preserves the fermionic relations, to ensure that the mapped operators only produce states inside that fermionic subset; meaning that the computation should not, noise aside, produce non-physical states. Doing so reduces the scope for errors.$^3$\n",

    "The mapping has to encode the positions of the electrons and do so with a guarantee of anti-symmetry of the fermionic wave functions, to respect fermion algebra. There are thus two pieces of information: the electron occupancy on each site and the overall parity. The Jordan-Wigner mapping fully localizes the occupation number (each qubit represents the occupation on a site), which then causes the parity to be completely non-localized: whenever an electron \"hops\" sites, the parity update requires an update to all qubits, propagated through a chain of controlled gates. The Bravyi-Kitaev transform encodes both occupancy and parity information non-locally, leading to a more balanced result.\n",

    "**Exercise:** Check the circuits again and find that the Jordan-Wigner mapping results in many more series of CNOTs involving all qubits than does Bravyi-Kitaev.

    "A circuit optimized by BQSKit is no longer explicitly parametrized (optimizing a fully instantiate circuit leads to better results than when the parametrization is left in-place in the form of gates), but can still serve as a template. Many classical optimizers use an iterative parameter search (e.g. gradient descent), where the next iteration is a tweak on the current parameter set, meaning that the current circuit instance requested is likely to be close to the previous one. Furthermore, even when the optimizer uses a different approach, such as a stencil or grid, where the parameters are further apart, the overall structure of the final optimized current circuit is still likely to be close to the previous one, because it still describes the same physical system.\n",

For example, a noise-resilient optimizer is needed and even then, the final energy result obtained is likely to be higher than the global minimum, even when the final parameters are spot-on. Additionally, simulation with noise takes considerably longer than without, and multiple runs are needed for convincing statistics.\n",
