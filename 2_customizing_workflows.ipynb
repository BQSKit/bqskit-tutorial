    "We will solve the Hubbard Model using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. The Hubbard Model (HM) has a range of uses, most notably in solid-state physics to explain phase transitions and other correlated behaviors. There are several variations of the HM, but in essence, the model describes interacting particles on a lattice. Despite its apparent simplicity, it is hard to solve on a classical computer because the known algorithms scale exponentially unless further approximations are made. In this tutorial, we will use the VQE algorithm to estimate the energy ground states of different configurations of an HM."

    "\n",
    "We will restrict ourselves to a Hubbard Model with fermions (such as electrons), i.e. the Fermi-Hubbard Model. A visualization of an example with a 2x2 grid with spinful electrons is shown below. Electrons being fermions means that two electrons can not occupy the same quantum state. Because the electrons have spin, there can thus be at most two electrons per site (one spin-up, one spin-down). The model is characterized by an interaction term 'U', which only contributes if a spin-up and a spin-down electron occupy the same site; and by a \"hopping\" term 't', representing the kinetic energy in the system. In this basic model, only hops to neighboring sites are considered.\n",

    "Fermion algebra is only a subset of what a quantum computer can express, since fermions are interchangeable and many states are thus completely equivalent, whereas qubits are identifiable (each one has a well defined location on a chip or ion trap, for example). Thus, it is useful to perform a mapping from fermion to qubit algebra that preserves the fermionic relations, to ensure that the mapped operators only produce states inside that fermionic subset; meaning that the computation should not, noise aside, produce non-physical states. Doing so reduces the scope for errors.$^3$\n",

    "The mapping has to encode the positions of the electrons and do so with a guarantee of anti-symmetry of the fermionic wave functions, to respect fermion algebra. There are thus two pieces of information: the electron occupancy on each site and the overall parity. The Jordan-Wigner mapping fully localizes the occupation number (each qubit represents the occupation on a site), which then causes the parity to be completely non-localized: whenever an electron \"hops\" sites, the parity update requires an update to all qubits, propagated through a chain of controlled gates. The Bravyi-Kitaev transform encodes both occupancy and parity information non-locally, leading to a more balanced result.\n",

    "**Exercise:** Check the circuits again and find that the Jordan-Wigner mapping results in many more series of CNOTs involving all qubits than does Bravyi-Kitaev.

    "Seeded Synthesis for Improving Variational Workflows\n",
    "----------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "This section discusses how we can leverage knowledge about our specific problem, a variational Hubbard model simulation, to build a compilation workflow that fits its needs much better than BQSKit off-the-shelf.\n",
    "In a variational setting, we run many circuits sequentially, modifying them slightly between each iteration. The time cost between each iteration is significant in an experimental environment as QPU access time is not cheap for two main reasons.\n",
    "First, QPU time may cost actual currency and be very expensive, so we want to minimize the time idling waiting to compile a new circuit. Second, while idling the QPU may be drifting causing a type of noise that may be hard to handle in the algorithm.\n",
    "Therefore, a long-running compilation workflow may not be advantageous in a variational setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This being said, there are two positive observations that we can make from this environment that we can use to guide the creation of a custom workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We have practically unlimited time before accessing the QPU to perform analysis and compilation on the first circuit in sequence.\n",
    "2. The circuits are not likely to change much between each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first observation allows us to perform deep compilation and analysis routines on the circuit before starting the algorithm.\n",
    "In contrast, the second point enables us to \"seed\" a compilation workflow from the results of a previous iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the rest of this section, we will first learn how to do compilation seed analysis, then combine that with first-compilation detection to build a variational compilation workflow that greatly improves compile time without hurting compile quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before we start, let's get a baseline:"

For example, a noise-resilient optimizer is needed and even then, the final energy result obtained is likely to be higher than the global minimum, even when the final parameters are spot-on.
